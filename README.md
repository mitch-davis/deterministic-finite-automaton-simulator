Simulates several DFAs based on descriptions and input strings
<br>
<br>
Automata Descriptions contains all of the machine descriptions, input strings, and results that are generated by running the program
<br>
<br>
file extensions explanation:
<br>
<br>
.fa## - description of a finite automaton
<br>
.in## - input strings for the FA
<br>
.acc## - list of accepted input strings (generated at run-time)
<br>
.rej## - list of rejected input strings (generated at run-time)
<br>
.txt## - report for the machine simulation
<br>
<br>
non-deterministic FAs can be recognized but are not simulated
