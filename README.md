Simulates several DFAs based on descriptions and input strings

\Automata Descriptions contains all of the machine descriptions, input strings, and results that are generated by running the program

file extensions explanation:
.fa## - description of a finite automaton
.in## - input strings for the FA
.acc## - list of accepted input strings (generated at run-time)
.rej## - list of rejected input strings (generated at run-time)
.txt## - report for the machine simulation

non-deterministic FAs can be recognized but are not simulated
